# Product Context: Finite Velocity Diffusion Solver

## Problem Domain

Classical diffusion models (governed by Fick's law) predict that disturbances propagate at infinite speeds, which violates causality principles. This unphysical behavior becomes particularly problematic when modeling:

1. Heat transfer in ultrafast processes
2. Signaling in biological systems
3. Wave-like transport phenomena
4. Electromagnetic wave propagation in lossy media

The finite velocity diffusion equation (telegrapher's equation) solves this issue by incorporating a relaxation time (τ) that limits the propagation speed to a finite value, making the model physically realistic.

## Target Users

The Finite Velocity Diffusion Solver is designed for:

1. **Researchers**: Scientists studying transport phenomena, hyperbolic PDEs, or wave-like diffusion
2. **Students**: Those learning about non-Fickian diffusion and the telegrapher's equation
3. **Educators**: Professors or teachers demonstrating wave-like diffusion phenomena
4. **Engineers**: Professionals modeling transport processes with finite propagation speeds

## User Experience Goals

Users should be able to:

1. **Explore Intuitively**: Adjust parameters and immediately see their effects without needing to understand the underlying numerical methods
2. **Visualize Clearly**: View solution behavior through multiple visualization approaches
3. **Compare Directly**: Observe differences between classical and finite velocity diffusion models
4. **Understand Deeply**: Gain insight into how the relaxation time affects the wave-like nature of the solutions
5. **Iterate Rapidly**: Quickly test different configurations without excessive waiting times

## Core Use Cases

1. **Educational Demonstrations**: Illustrate the wave-like nature of finite velocity diffusion compared to classical diffusion
2. **Parameter Exploration**: Investigate how changing diffusion coefficient (D) and relaxation time (τ) affects solutions
3. **Time Evolution Analysis**: Observe how disturbances propagate over time with a finite speed
4. **Dimensional Comparison**: Compare behavior between 1D and 2D systems
5. **Research Validation**: Test hypothesis about propagation behavior in non-classical diffusion scenarios

## Value Proposition

This solver provides:

1. **Physical Realism**: Models diffusion with the causality constraint of finite propagation speeds
2. **Interactive Learning**: Makes complex PDE behavior accessible through visual exploration
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Directly shows the practical differences between classical and finite velocity diffusion
4. **Flexible Visualization**: Offers multiple ways to understand and analyze solutions
5. **Accessibility**: Makes sophisticated numerical solutions available through a simple interface

Through this tool, users can develop intuition about wave-like diffusion phenomena and explore the fascinating middle ground between pure wave equations and classical diffusion equations.
