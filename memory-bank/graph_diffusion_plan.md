# Graph Diffusion Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a new section in the Finite Velocity Diffusion application that focuses on exploring diffusion processes on graph structures. This will include both ordinary diffusion (heat equation) and finite-velocity diffusion (telegrapher's equation) on graphs, with optional support for including potential terms.

## Core Components

### 1. Graph Representation

We will implement graph structures and operations using NetworkX with the following capabilities:

- **Graph Types**:
  - Grid graphs (2D lattice, triangular, hexagonal)
  - Random graphs (Erdős–Rényi, Barabási–Albert)
  - Custom graph construction
  
- **Graph Properties**:
  - Vertex degree distribution
  - Edge weights
  - Node positioning for visualization
  - Laplacian matrix calculation

### 2. Graph Diffusion Solvers

We will implement multiple diffusion models on graphs:

- **Ordinary Diffusion on Graphs**:
  - Heat equation: ∂u/∂t = D∇²u
  - Implementation using graph Laplacian

- **Finite-Velocity Diffusion on Graphs**:
  - Telegrapher's equation: τ∂²u/∂t² + ∂u/∂t = D∇²u
  - Implementation using graph Laplacian

- **Diffusion with Potential Term (Optional)**:
  - Extended equation: τ∂²u/∂t² + ∂u/∂t = D∇²u - V(x)u
  - Allow for vertex-specific potential values

### 3. Visualization

We will create visualization tools specifically for graphs:

- **Static Graph Visualization**:
  - Node colors representing concentration values
  - Node sizes potentially representing other properties
  - Edge weights visualization

- **Time Evolution Visualization**:
  - Interactive slider for time evolution
  - Animation of concentration changes
  - Comparative view of different diffusion models

### 4. UI Components

The UI will include components for:

- **Graph Construction**:
  - Graph type selection
  - Graph parameters (size, connectivity, etc.)
  - Predefined graph examples

- **Diffusion Parameters**:
  - Diffusion coefficient (D)
  - Relaxation time (τ)
  - Initial condition selection
  - Potential term configuration (if implemented)

- **Visualization Controls**:
  - Visualization type selection
  - Time evolution controls
  - Comparison options

### 5. Analysis Tools

We will provide tools for analyzing:

- **Convergence Properties**:
  - How different graph structures affect convergence
  - Stability conditions on graphs

- **Diffusion Characteristics**:
  - Propagation behavior in different graph topologies
  - Comparison between ordinary and finite-velocity diffusion

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Structure

1. Create the new page file: `03_Graph_Diffusion.py`
2. Create the components file: `components/graph_diffusion.py`
3. Create the graph solver file: `solver/graph_solver.py`
4. Create the graph visualization file: `visualization/graph_visualization.py`
5. Update requirements.txt to include NetworkX

### Phase 2: Graph Infrastructure

1. Implement graph construction functions for different graph types
2. Create UI components for graph selection and parameter configuration
3. Implement graph Laplacian calculation
4. Create basic graph visualization

### Phase 3: Ordinary Diffusion

1. Implement ordinary diffusion (heat equation) solver for graphs
2. Create visualization for ordinary diffusion results
3. Implement time evolution for ordinary diffusion
4. Add UI controls for ordinary diffusion parameters

### Phase 4: Finite-Velocity Diffusion

1. Implement finite-velocity diffusion (telegrapher's equation) solver for graphs
2. Create visualization for finite-velocity diffusion results
3. Implement time evolution for finite-velocity diffusion
4. Add UI controls for finite-velocity diffusion parameters

### Phase 5: Comparison and Analysis

1. Implement comparison between ordinary and finite-velocity diffusion
2. Create analysis tools for diffusion properties on graphs
3. Add educational information about graph diffusion
4. Implement potential term functionality (if time permits)

### Phase 6: Integration and Testing

1. Integrate with parameter persistence system
2. Ensure compatibility with existing app structure
3. Test functionality across different graph types and parameters
4. Optimize performance for large graphs

## Technical Considerations

### Graph Laplacian Implementation

The graph Laplacian is crucial for diffusion on graphs:
- For unweighted graphs: L = D - A, where D is the degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix
- For weighted graphs: L = D - W, where W is the weighted adjacency matrix

We'll use NetworkX's built-in Laplacian functions and extend them as needed.

### Stability Conditions

Stability conditions for finite-velocity diffusion on graphs may differ from the continuous case:
- Will need to derive appropriate Courant-like conditions for graphs
- May need to adjust time steps based on graph properties

### Performance Optimization

For larger graphs:
- Limit graph size for interactive performance
- Use sparse matrix operations where possible
- Consider caching intermediate results

### Graph Visualization

To effectively visualize diffusion on graphs:
- Use appropriate layout algorithms for different graph types
- Color mapping should effectively show concentration changes
- May need to implement custom visualization for comparative analysis

## Dependencies

- NetworkX for graph manipulation and analysis
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Plotly for visualization
- Streamlit for the user interface
