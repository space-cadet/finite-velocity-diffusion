## Current Status

The project is in a functional state with a multipage Streamlit application. The main page provides interactive 1D and 2D simulations with various visualization options. The Parameter Analysis page offers tools to explore parameter relationships and stability conditions. The Numerical Analysis page provides tools for analyzing convergence and error properties.

The Graph Diffusion page is now fully implemented with comprehensive capabilities:

1. **Graph Construction**: Users can create various graph types (grid, triangular, hexagonal, ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi, BarabÃ¡siâ€“Albert, and custom graphs) with customizable parameters
2. **Graph Visualization**: Interactive 2D and 3D visualization of graph structures with different coloring options (degree, centrality, etc.)
3. **Diffusion Simulation**: Numerical solvers for different diffusion types:
   - Ordinary diffusion (heat equation)
   - Finite-velocity diffusion (telegrapher's equation)
   - Diffusion with potential terms
4. **Initial Conditions**: Multiple initial condition types (delta function, Gaussian, random) with preview functionality
5. **Time Evolution**: Visualization of how diffusion processes evolve over time on graph structures
6. **Interactive Controls**: Time sliders, animation capabilities, and visualization settings
7. **Animation Systems**: 
   - Custom Streamlit-based animation with play/pause/stop/reset controls
   - Plotly-based frame animation with smooth transitions and built-in controls
   - Animation speed adjustment for better visualization

Recent improvements include:

1. **Enhanced Animations**: Implemented Plotly's frame-based animation system for smoother visualizations without page flashing
2. **Improved Controls**: Added comprehensive animation controls and preview functionality for better user experience
3. **Cross-Compatibility**: Fixed node ID handling to ensure all graph types (grid, ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi, etc.) work correctly together
4. **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for various graph structures and node values
5. **Visualization Persistence**: Ensured visualization type preferences are preserved across different operations

The application architecture has been modularized with clear separation of concerns:
- Core solvers in the `solver/` directory
- Visualization functions in the `visualization/` directory
- UI components in the `pages/components/` directory
- Clear interface between UI and solver logic

Parameter persistence has been implemented using file-based storage, allowing user settings to be remembered between sessions. The application structure has been modularized with a clear separation between pages, components, and core functionality.

Documentation is being enhanced through the memory bank system to facilitate ongoing development. No critical bugs have been identified in the core solving functionality, though there are opportunities for optimization and feature expansion.

## Known Issues

1. **Performance in 2D**: Large 2D simulations can be computationally intensive and may cause lag in the interactive interface
2. **Memory Usage**: Time evolution storage for long simulations with many time steps can consume significant memory
3. **Boundary Effects**: Default Neumann boundaries may show artifacts for some parameter combinations
4. **Animation Performance**: Plotly animations can be resource-intensive in browsers for long time evolutions, especially with large graphs
5. **Parameter Analysis Approximations**: Some of the parameter analysis tools use simplified models that may not exactly match simulation results
6. **Large Graph Performance**: Graph simulations with many nodes (>100) may be slow and memory-intensive
7. **Browser Compatibility**: Plotly animations may perform differently across browsers and hardware configurations
8. **Node ID Handling**: While fixed for most cases, some edge cases might still have node ID compatibility issues between different graph types
9. **UI Reactivity**: Some UI controls may have delayed updates due to Streamlit's rerun-based state management
