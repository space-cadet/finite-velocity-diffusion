## Current Status

The project is in a functional state with a multipage Streamlit application. The main page provides interactive 1D and 2D simulations with various visualization options. The Parameter Analysis page offers tools to explore parameter relationships and stability conditions. The Numerical Analysis page provides tools for analyzing convergence and error properties.

Parameter persistence has been implemented using file-based storage, allowing user settings to be remembered between sessions. The application structure has been modularized with a clear separation between pages, components, and core functionality.

Documentation is being enhanced through the memory bank system to facilitate ongoing development. No critical bugs have been identified in the core solving functionality, though there are opportunities for optimization and feature expansion.

## Known Issues

1. **Performance in 2D**: Large 2D simulations can be computationally intensive and may cause lag in the interactive interface
2. **Memory Usage**: Time evolution storage for long simulations with many time steps can consume significant memory
3. **Boundary Effects**: Default Neumann boundaries may show artifacts for some parameter combinations
4. **Animation Performance**: Plotly animations can be resource-intensive in browsers for long time evolutions
5. **Parameter Analysis Approximations**: Some of the parameter analysis tools use simplified models that may not exactly match simulation results

## Next Milestones

1. **Enhanced Testing**: Develop comprehensive test suite for all solver components
2. **Documentation Completion**: Finalize memory bank documentation and enhance code comments
3. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and implement key performance improvements
4. **Additional Analysis Tools**: Develop quantitative metrics for solution analysis

This progress report will be updated as development continues.
