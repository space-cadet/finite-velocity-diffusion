# Active Context: Finite Velocity Diffusion Solver

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in a functional state with operational 1D and 2D solvers and a Streamlit interface. Current focus areas include:

1. **Documentation Improvement**: Creating comprehensive memory bank documentation to enable future development
2. **Potential Optimizations**: Identifying opportunities to enhance performance, especially for 2D simulations
3. **UI Refinements**: Exploring improvements to the user interface for better usability
4. **Visualization Enhancements**: Considering additional visualization options or improvements

## Recent Changes

1. **Memory Bank Setup**: Creation of the memory bank documentation system to facilitate development continuity
2. **Project Structure Documentation**: Comprehensive mapping of the existing codebase structure and organization
3. **Core Algorithm Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the solver implementations and their theoretical basis

## Active Decisions

1. **Documentation Strategy**: 
   - Decision to use a memory bank approach for maintaining project knowledge
   - Organization of memory bank files into core categories (project brief, product context, system patterns, etc.)

2. **Development Priorities**:
   - Focus on consolidating existing functionality before adding new features
   - Importance of maintaining educational clarity in the codebase

3. **Performance vs. Clarity**:
   - Continuing to prioritize code clarity for educational purposes
   - Identifying selective optimizations that don't sacrifice readability

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Test Coverage**: Evaluate and potentially expand test coverage for the solver implementations
2. **Parameter Validation**: Enhance input validation for user-provided parameters
3. **Code Comments**: Review and enhance in-code documentation where needed

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Additional Analysis Tools**: Implement tools for quantitative comparison between classical and finite velocity diffusion
2. **Extended Boundary Conditions**: Support for different boundary condition types (Dirichlet, Robin, etc.)
3. **Performance Profiling**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks, especially in 2D simulations

### Long-term Vision

1. **Extended Dimensions**: Consider adding 3D simulation capabilities
2. **Additional Physics**: Incorporate other physical phenomena or coupled equations
3. **Advanced Numerics**: Explore implicit schemes or higher-order methods for improved accuracy and stability

## Key Considerations

1. **Educational Value**: Maintain focus on clarity and educational utility of the implementation
2. **Computational Efficiency**: Balance between accuracy and interactive performance
3. **User Experience**: Ensure intuitive exploration of complex physical phenomena
4. **Code Maintainability**: Preserve modular structure and separation of concerns

## Current Questions

1. How can we optimize 2D simulations for better interactive performance without sacrificing accuracy?
2. What additional visualization approaches might enhance understanding of wave-like diffusion behavior?
3. Are there interesting physical scenarios or initial conditions that would showcase the unique properties of finite velocity diffusion?
4. What metrics would be most useful for quantitative comparison between classical and finite velocity diffusion?

This active context will be updated as development progresses and new insights emerge.
