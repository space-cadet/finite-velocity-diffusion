# Active Context: Finite Velocity Diffusion Solver

## Current Work Focus

The project is now a fully functional multipage Streamlit application with:

1. **Main Simulation Page**: Functional 1D and 2D solvers with visualization options
2. **Parameter Analysis Page**: Tools to explore how different parameters affect propagation speed, wave-diffusion behavior, and stability conditions
3. **Numerical Analysis Page**: Tools for convergence and error analysis

We have added a new section focused on graph-based diffusion:

4. **Graph Diffusion Page**: A new page to explore diffusion on graphs using both ordinary and finite-velocity diffusion models, with and without potential terms. The graph construction and visualization components are now functional.

Current focus areas include:

1. **Graph-Based Diffusion Implementation**: Developing the new graph diffusion features
2. **Memory Bank Maintenance**: Ensuring the memory bank documentation is up-to-date with the latest changes
3. **Potential Optimizations**: Identifying opportunities to enhance performance, especially for 2D simulations
4. **UI Refinements**: Continuing to improve the user interface for better usability
5. **Additional Analysis Tools**: Considering additional tools for deeper analysis of solution properties

## Recent Changes

1. **Multipage App Structure**: Implementation of a multipage Streamlit application with specialized pages for different types of analysis
2. **Parameter Persistence**: Implementation of file-based parameter persistence to remember user settings between sessions
3. **Parameter Analysis Tools**: Addition of tools to analyze how parameters affect propagation speed, wave-diffusion behavior, and stability conditions
4. **Numerical Analysis Tools**: Addition of tools to analyze convergence and error properties of numerical solutions
5. **Component Organization**: Improved organization with modular components for each page
6. **Graph Diffusion UI Implementation**: Implementation of graph construction and visualization UI for the Graph Diffusion page
7. **Graph Visualization**: Static and interactive 2D/3D visualization of graph structures using Plotly and NetworkX

## Active Decisions

1. **Multipage Structure**: 
   - Main page focuses on running simulations and visualizing results
   - Parameter Analysis page provides tools for understanding parameter relationships
   - Numerical Analysis page provides tools for analyzing numerical properties
   - Graph Diffusion page focuses on exploring diffusion processes on graph structures with UI elements organized for better user experience (graph construction in sidebar, visualization in main area)

2. **Parameter Persistence Strategy**:
   - File-based persistence using JSON storage
   - Parameters saved immediately when changed through the UI
   - Session state initialized from saved file or defaults

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Pages directory contains the different pages of the application
   - Components directory within pages contains reusable UI components
   - Main application components in streamlit_ui directory

4. **Development Priorities**:
   - Focus on educational value and parameter exploration tools
   - Balance between computational performance and interactive responsiveness
   - Maintain modularity for future extensions
