        ## Graphs and Diffusion Processes
        
        ### What are Graphs?
        
        Graphs (or networks) are mathematical structures consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They are used to model pairwise relations between objects. In our context, graphs provide a discrete domain on which diffusion processes can occur.
        
        ### Types of Graphs
        
        - **Grid (Lattice)**: Regular arrangement of nodes, like a mesh or grid
        - **Triangular Lattice**: Each face is a triangle
        - **Hexagonal Lattice**: Each face is a hexagon
        - **Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi**: Random graph where each possible edge has equal probability of being created
        - **Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert**: Scale-free network following preferential attachment (leads to power-law degree distribution)
        
        ### Diffusion on Graphs
        
        Diffusion on graphs is analogous to diffusion in continuous space, but occurs along the edges of the graph. The diffusion equation on a graph uses the graph Laplacian operator instead of the continuous Laplacian.
        
        #### Ordinary Diffusion (Heat Equation)
        
        The ordinary diffusion equation on graphs is:
        
        ```
        ‚àÇu/‚àÇt = D ‚àá¬≤·µç u
        ```
        
        where ‚àá¬≤·µç is the graph Laplacian.
        
        #### Finite-Velocity Diffusion (Telegrapher's Equation)
        
        The finite-velocity diffusion equation on graphs is:
        
        ```
        œÑ ‚àÇ¬≤u/‚àÇt¬≤ + ‚àÇu/‚àÇt = D ‚àá¬≤·µç u
        ```
        
        This equation ensures that diffusion occurs with a finite propagation speed on the graph.
        
        ### Graph Laplacian
        
        The graph Laplacian is defined as:
        
        ```
        L = D - A
        ```
        
        where D is the degree matrix (diagonal matrix with node degrees) and A is the adjacency matrix of the graph.
        
        For weighted graphs, the weighted Laplacian uses the weighted adjacency matrix.
